## Problem Statement
As YouTube becomes one of the most popular video-sharing platforms, YouTuber is developed as a new type of career in recent decades. YouTubers earn money through advertising revenue from YouTube videos, sponsorships from companies, merchandise sales, and donations from their fans. In order to maintain a stable income, the popularity of videos become the top priority for YouTubers. Meanwhile, some of our friends are YouTubers or channel owners in other video-sharing platforms.
