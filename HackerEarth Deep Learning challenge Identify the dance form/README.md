## Problem statement

This International Dance Day, an event management company organized an evening of Indian classical dance performances to celebrate the rich, eloquent, and elegant art of dance. Post the event, the company planned to create a microsite to promote and raise awareness among the public about these dance forms. However, identifying them from images is a tough nut to crack.

You have been appointed as a Machine Learning Engineer for this project. Build an image tagging Deep Learning model that can help the company classify these images into eight categories of Indian classical dance.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 364 images belonging to 8 categories, namely manipuri, bharatanatyam, odissi, kathakali, kathak, sattriya, kuchipudi, and mohiniyattam.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that classify images into multiple categories
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of classification actively. It is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning and Deep Learning
We challenge you to build a model that auto-tags images and classifies them into various categories of Indian classical dance forms.
