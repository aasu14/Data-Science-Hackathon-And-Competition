## Problem
Shell, in collaboration with MachineHack & Analytics India Magazine, asks talented minds to tackle the exponential growth of cyber threats and improve the security and resilience of web applications. 
The aim of the Cyber Threat Detection Hackathon is to build a next-gen model capable of identifying code in a body of text. 

Protecting our software landscapes is not an easy task. Malicious actors are frequently trying to enter systems and get access to resources, whether operational or data. 
The ability for an actor to compromise systems, elevate their privileges, and move laterally within infrastructure typically hinges on executing hidden code. 
One common method they employ is embedding this code in seemingly harmless media—whether it's images, videos, or even simple text files.

 In this hackathon, we will provide a body of text in which you will try to find the source code hidden in the text. There might not be any source control or multiple sections of source code concealed within the text. 
 Don’t miss an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities, innovate, and make a name for yourself in the world. 

## Data Description
