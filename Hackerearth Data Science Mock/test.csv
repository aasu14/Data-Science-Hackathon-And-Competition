"I use the book 'Fortify Your Life' by Tieraona Low Dog, MD to help me make more informed decisions regarding supplements.  I went over this supplement from ""X Brand"" elements & found some negatives if you're not Vegan:<br /><br />Contains Folate as Folic Acid.  Folic Acid is the synthetic form of Folate.<br />Vitamin B12 as cyanocobalamin.  Cyanocobalamin is the synthetic form.  this is a supplement that is targeted to Vegans.  So this may not be an issue depending on what you are looking for.  However, the body is better able to absorb Methylcobalamin, it is the form of B12 the body needs.<br />Vitamin C as ascorbic acid.  Ascorbic Acid is the synthetic form of Vit.C<br />Vitamin D2 - this is a supplement that is targeted to Vegans.  So this may not be an issue depending on what you are looking for.  However, the body is better able to absorb D3.  D3 is the optimal choice for good health.<br />Chromium as Chromium Chloride.  Chromium Chloride is the least absorbed form.<br />Contains Iron.  This may not be an issue depending on what you are looking for.  Teenage boys, adult men, women with very infrequent menstrual cycles, & postmenopausal women should NOT take multivitamins with iron.<br />The probiotics are a joke.  There is no guarantee that you will get live beneficial bacteria at the time of consumption.  Any good probiotic supplier will guarantee a particular amount of viable probiotic strain/s at the time of consumption (it will say it right on the label).<br /><br />Personally, I feel that the Pure Synergy brand is the better choice for supplements.  I tend to use them most of the time.  There is another brand, Mega Food backed by Dr. Low Dog that I haven't used, so I cannot speak on it's quality, but you may wish to check it out if you don't want/like the Synergy brand.<br /><br />Overall, this is a reasonable multivitamin for Vegans due to ethical reasons for being Vegan, not for actual good health.  But with that said, it's better than not taking a multivitamin at all.","Good Vegan Choice, Poor Non Vegan Choice",Ingredients

"I bought these for my girlfriend, who I couldn't talk out of buying.  I have a Ph.D. in Neuropharmacology and know that taking high levels of the precursor chemicals the body uses to make neurotransmitters has no meaningful effect on the levels of those neurotransmitters in the brain.  It doesn't work that way.  I'm sorry, I wish it were that simple... Don't believe the hype.",These suppliments don't work - No suppliment significantly changes neurochemistry,Not Effective

I really wanted to give these a try and noticed I was getting TERRIBLE headaches and narrowed it down to the vitamins. Everyday I would wake up and take only one and then O would have a headache and stabbing head pain all day and also felt nauseous constantly. I thought I was just sick. Then I read some of the reviews about Vitex and how it’s not good. As soon as I stopped taking them I was back to normal no more pain or nausea. I really hope they just take that ingredient out.,Vitex,Allergic

"Buyer beware: these vitamins are not technically vegan: there is an ingredient, Vitamin D3; that comes from animal sources. I think these are designated as ""vegan"" because they claim that no animals were killed to make these (and that is likely true) but they do contain animal derived ingredients. That said, I think most vegans don't want to consume any animal derived ingredients. Since I have allergies, I could not take these, and ended up giving them away. I will say that ""X Brand""'s Customer Service is almost always great though; so I would not hesitate to order any of their house brand products, as they stand behind them and will remedy any issues if they don't work out.","These are not vegan, but ""X Brand""'s Customer Service is great.",Not Effective

"I was hoping for the best with this supplement after reading some promising studies about the positive effects of Quercetin on aging reversal and its apparent anti-inflammatory properties when dealing with Ulcerative Colitis.  Unfortunately, this didn't work for me, and I would caution anyone in using it to proceed carefully.  I followed the directions, taking it 30 minutes prior to meals.  I started on the lowest possible dose, one per day (instead of the recommended two per day).  I took it for three days, and had to stop because it caused many side-effects including stomach pain, foggy brain, and anxiety (and I never ever get any anxiety).  I didn't notice anything positive or any other results from taking it other than the negative side effects.  I stopped after the first three days, gave it about a week off, and then tried again, and then the same thing happened on the second run and then again on a third run.  After the third run I have concluded this was causing me more pain and discomfort overall.

Honestly sucked when I tried using for my body butters. I didn’t realize until after my purchase that it was diluted with jojoba oil (which is my fault for not seeing that). But even after realizing it was diluted the smell wasn’t even faint. I had to basically shove my nose down the bottle to even get a trace of any scent and it wasn’t even a nice vanilla smell but some weird burnt artificial vanilla smell. Considering it’s $19 almost $20 at the time of this review I would say it’s not worth it for the amount you receive or the smell.,NOT FAINT AND DEFINITELY NOT STRONG,Texture

"As of this review this bottle of adult vitamins cost $22.39.  It's for a four month supply and only one pill per day is the dosage given, though the amount of a lot of the vitamins is only 1/2 the RDA.  If two were taken then the full amount plus some extra would be taken.  They're basically o.k. except for the vitamin D2 content instead D3.  Vitamin manufacturers often use D2 instead because it's cheaper to produce thus saving them money, but it's not really much good.  D2 mostly goes right through the digestive tract and into the toilet so very little get absorbed and it does practically nothing for bone health.  D3 on the other hand, costs a little more to manufacture, but is by far a superior form of vitamin D.  Most of it gets absorbed and combined with a good K2 does a good job at maintaining good bone health.  I would be sure to take a good D3 supplement if taking these vitamins.<br /><br />The iron content might be too high for post menopausal women and I don't really know if men should be taking more iron or not.  But, it's a good amount for women who are menstruating.  18 mg is the RDA and one of these pills gives 9 mg but that's not too bad.

After the fact, my doctor told me that she was very worried for me when I went in to her while on these. She said she thought I might end up in the hospital with a nervous breakdown! It was so scary. But luckily, I’ve been feeling fine since stopping them. I knew that maca made me feel anxious, and I should have read the ingredients more clearly. If you know that you are sensitive to maca, do not take.",Gave me terrible anxiety,Allergic

This was my 3rd vegan protein powder that i’ve tried and it was by far the worst. Too gritty and the flavor just wasn’t good at all in my opinion.

Now I'll start this review by stating i have a decent tolerance level when it comes to preworkouts.  I decided to try this one month ago and just finished it. I am pretty disappointed with the results.<br />I did as the bottle suggested and started with one scoop and escalated from there. Turns out I needed 3 1/2 scoops to feel the pump and it really only lasted for about half my workout. Workout was only between 30-45 minutes.<br />The biggest annoying factor was that the powder is terrible at dissolving. The flavor was strong and good. Once you reach the bottom its like swallowing a pixie stick. By far the worst thing about it. Not happy qith it but will work for beginners or those who are not tolerant to it,Sucks at dissolving,Bad Taste/Flavor

At the current price of $17.99 for a 45 day supply I would not purchase this once I am finished with this set.,No difference I can see!,Not Effective
Would not buy from this seller again. Pills would flake out even tho the bottle says it expires at a later time. Purchased again from a reliable source and didn’t have that flaking pill issue.,Pills flake after opening bottle,Customer Service

"I purchased another variety of vitamin (Undeniable Beauty, with C, E, Biotin and Keratin) and LOVED them and had great results. Before I even opened the bottle of these I could smell a very strong smell of vitamins. Which is totally different than the experience I had with their other product. It was worse than the smell from the tablets I usually taste. I almost didn't eat one but I took a chance and regretted from the moment I put it in my mouth. The gummy tasted like pure vitamins, and not in a good way. I'd much rather take my regular multi-vitamin. I tasted vitamins in my mouth and burped it up for hours. I tried to give them to my mom and she couldn't take it either. I don't know how the two products from the same company can vary so much. The other product had ZERO vitamin taste, I left that other product I mentioned a 5-star review. I had to throw the bottle away because I couldn't take the smell, never had an experience like that with vitamins, where you could smell them with the jar closed. Maybe I got a bad jar? I don't know, but I will stick with my regular multi-vitamin. I do however highly recommend their Undeniable Beauty, they have a great fruity taste.",These have the worst smell and vitamin-y taste.

I had taken the Nature Made Prenatal throughout 2 pregnancies and never had any issues. I found these postnatal and decided to give them a try while nursing my 2nd child. The reviews are true - they smell and taste much worse than the prenatal version. This isn't usually an issue that bothers me. I can swallow them and take them but it isn't as pleasant. I don't notice it after taking them though so I'll use them but wouldn't buy them again. I'm not sure what makes them so different from the prenatal.,Bad taste and scent,Bad Taste/Flavor

I like that it is a gentle product that isn't irritating to my sensitive, acne prone, and now ageing skin.  Critical to me are the fact that the cleanser is affordable, non-comedogenic, and fragrance free<br /><br />When I saw that ""X Brand""'s brand Solimo, created a similar gentle skin cleanser.  Considering that Solimo sells its cleanser for $2.00 less than Cetaphil, I thought it was worth a try to determine whether it was worth a permanent switch.<br /><br />The consistency of the cleanser is very similar to Cetaphil; it is a viscous, opaque soap that pumps easily from the bottle.  It is a gentle cleanser, therefore, it can be used with water or without.  When traveling without access to hot water, I notice that just rubbing on my face and wiping off with a washcloth works just fine.  With access to normal amenities, I always wash off the cleanser with warm water and towel dry.<br /><br />This cleanser can also be used with or without water.  I noticed a difference however, in that wen I applied th ecleanser to my face, I detected a slight stinging - nothing that would really be noticeable, but noticeable tome because I have never gotten that sensation with Cetaphil.  The cleanser also dried my face out a tiny bit more than Cetaphil.

This product made me extremely sick almost immediately after drinking it. It’s like my body hit the emergency evacuation button. Not something you want to feel right in the morning. I took it as a am kickstart as claimed on the packaging. Although upon opening it has a very strong and desirable cotton candy smell (like fresh from a carnival) The product does not taste like cotton candy at all. I was expecting cotton candy flavor like you taste in the bang energy. Instead it tasted watered down sour taste. Returning immediately.,Made me very sick,Bad Taste/Flavor

"As a vegetarian (not vegan)who recently started a boot camp workout routine, I’ve been looking for extra ways to supplement my protein. I’d previously been using Isopure Zero Carb, but the whey was starting to irritate my stomach. I found Garden Of Life Raw Protein at my local Lucky’s Market and decided to give it a try since I love chai flavor. A quick peak at the ""X Brand"" rating showed 4 stars, and they had individual serving packets that would let me try without committing to the tub, so I figured why not. Once I got home, I started reading the recent reviews and was a bit less confident. Tried it anyway. While the flavor isn’t bad, the texture is so difficult to stomach. Like... it’s really bad. Have to choke it down bad. It mixes okay (no heavy chunks of powder or anything), but is so grainy it’s like drinking wet sand. You’d think it was a lesson learned, but I decided to give the chocolate flavor a shot. This time I blended it with ice because certainly THAT would hide the texture. Nope. Same gritty texture, just colder. Wish I’d gotten to try this before the reformulation so I could see what the old reviews were raving about.

The biggest reason I was forced to stop using these is the BOX. Several times the boxes have split open and spilled dozens of bags all over the floor...do you know how annoying it is to pick up bags like these and then attempt to stack them up neatly and get them back into said box? It became so frustrating that I decided to just purchase a different brand. Also as others have stated the bags themselves are thin and can rip easily.,Expect the box to rip open every time,Packaging
"I didn’t notice much effect while taking  this proaduct, & there was no noticeable difference when I stopped taking it, which is usually how I can tell whether or not a such supplement is working. My biggest issue with this product is how much of I you have to take. The suggested use is 2 tablets 2-3 times a day, & it has to be taken with food. For me, it is not worth the hassle of taking it with every meal.",Underwhelming & Inconvenient,Not Effective

"This was my go-to product for drinkable potassium at 400mg per serving. I used it every day for years, for heartbeat stabilization and energy. Now, it's useless, and does the opposite of replenishing potassium. It makes a sodium imbalance worse, because there is double the sodium than potassium, and not enough potassium to bother. It's amounts larger than 1-200mg that need to be in water. For only 100mg, I can take a capsule. I cannot believe they ruined such a good product.

I tried to continue using the diffuser even with the loud noise, but it completely stopped working now altogether. This wasn’t really a cheap item and I’m not happy.

"It’s a challenge to find whey free and soy free protein supplements, but Garden of Life definitely helps with that challenge.

I prefer the raw protein and greens over the Fit simply due to taste. The Fit tastes like cinnamon and something else odd and overpowers everything else. I have to force myself to drink it because it’s too expensive to waste. Whereas the slightly sweet raw protein and greens has no distinct flavor.

"So I’m very health-conscious and try to take care of myself as best as I can. It’s important that I do so after years of abuse that I put my poor body through in the form of a life-threatening eating disorder. I crawled back from death more than a few times and now I’m finally in lasting recovery (knock on wood). I make sure I eat enough, exercise for health, and take a quality multivitamin (or right now, since I’m pregnant, prenatals). Sometimes I add additional single vitamins on their own to boost what’s in the multi. (More doesn’t always mean better when it comes to vitamins, though, so do your research and/or check with your healthcare professional. And remember - a healthy diet is the foundation of good health! 😉)<br /><br />I am usually not a fan of gummy vitamins because they contain mostly sugar and the percentage of the vitamins are way too low. I call them “glorified candy,” lol. Any gummy vitamin/supplement required you to down numerous gummies to equal the same amount in one capsule or tablet form. I decided to try these anyway because I figured since the percentage of vitamins aren’t too high, I could incorporate these into my pregnancy diet as an occasional treat and not overdo anything. I also liked that contain keratin.<br /><br />My bag of OLLY Undeniable Beauty Gummy arrived very fresh and soft and I really enjoy the refreshing grapefruit flavor. I do feel like I’m treating myself to some candy when I eat these - and since candy is just empty calories, it’s not something I indulge in too often. But everything in moderation, right? 😉<br /><br />I think these (and gummy vitamins/supplements in general) are best suited for people who just cannot swallow pills/capsules or for people who never take any vitamins and feel that taking a couple of these a day will be better than taking nothing. Like I stated a couple of times already, I don’t think the percentage of the necessary vitamins/supplement (in this case vitamin c, biotin, as well as keratin) are high enough to really do much on their own. At 2 gummies per serving and the bag being only a 30 day supply, it just isn’t a very cost-effective choice.<br /><br />I’m actually going to save the rest of these for after I give birth in September. In the postpartum period after I had my son 3.5 years ago, my hair fell out like you would not believe. It was completely distressing after having a thick, luxurious mane for the 9.5 months prior to his birth and I was so surprised I didn’t go bald. Lol and 😡. (It really is amazing how much hair is on the human head. Or maybe my hair loss looked even worse since my hair is long. In any case, losing all that hair is NOT something I want to experience ever again. Shudder. 😖)<br /><br />I will continue taking my prenatals and add these OLLY Undeniable Gummy vitamins after Baby Girl arrives. I will make sure to update and let you know how things go. Fingers crossed! 🤞",Yummy gummy vitamin+keratin. A spendy treat that has more merit than plain gummy candies.,Ingredients

On the whole I am a big fan of optimum products, I think they easily make the best Whey Protein and Micellular Creatine, but this product is just garbage.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty bad, but beyond that it is barely noticable (yes, I am mixing in the correct amount of water). So the flavor is super suttle, but also sub-par, so the overall flavor comes out like old nasty water. Beyond this, I have never felt an immediate effect from BCAAs before. Usually they are something that I drink mid workout or during fasted cardio to stay anabolic and see better results overtime. This BCAA formula, however, hits me in a way that I can immediately notice. I get jittery almost like I am drinking a preworkout. Ultimately not a good feeling. I have even had immediate changes in my vision, which is something I have not ever experienced from any supplement.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend that Optimum change this formula and I would recommend that you avoid purchasing. BPI Best BCAA and Ghost Lifestyle BCAA are easily the best alternatives currently on the market and I would strongly recommend either of those competitors over this product.<br /><br />Will not order again, but I do still love Optimum as a brand for their superior Whey Protein and Creatine products.

"I felt the moral obligation to write this review to let unsuspecting buyers know that while ALA is certainly healthy, you need a much higher amount than you'll get from this product if you're looking for a vegan alternative to fish oil, unless you're taking about 15 capsules per day. The NIH says the conversion rate for ALA to EPA and DHA is between 5% and 10%: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9637947. Usually, 500mg of EPA and DHA is the recommended minimum, so a 5% conversion from ALA would mean you need to consume 10 grams of ALA for a proper conversion to replace fish oil.<br /><br />Personally I would recommend just buying ground flaxseed and adding that to your food.

You would get a higher dose from eating a single peanut.",Very insignificant amount of ALA,Ingredients

"These are the absolute worst diapers!! This was my first order of these diapers in a size 5 and already SIX of the diapers have broke. By broke, I mean that the diapers just fell apart and the little material inside of the diaper that absorbs liquids just spilled out of the diaper, smeared all over my son, and got all on the floor/bed. If this happened once or twice then I would have ignored it and said that I just got a defective batch. But this has happened SIX times.

"My review is more regarding creatine in general rather the optimum brand- which makes great suppliments.<br /><br />I bought this about a month after starting rogaine so my hair was already thinning. My hair quickly started rapidly thinning...I know this by frequently cleaning hair clogging my shower drain, which had never happened before. I read rogaine causes hair shedding in the beginning and I assumed it was from that. After like 4 months of still rapidly loosing hair I made an appt with a hair loss specialist. From her, I realized creatine might had been the cause so I stopped using it. My hair loss rapidly slowed and I’m not cleaning the drain anymore. Apparently all the hair you lose due to creatine will grow back once you stop, so fingers crossed that’s my case.  Since for me hair is more important than muscles, I won’t be using creatine ever again. I’m aware other people might not feel the same or won’t have the same side effect as me. I just wanted anyone to know that if you do take it, be aware you could lose hair and monitor that","Beware, can majorly accelerate hair loss. Monitor use if concerned",Allergic

Tried keeping track of what i was eating, thinking maybe food related, but didn't seem to be.  So stopped taking the capsules, and after a couple of days, no more indigestion.  Started taking them again, just to see what would happen, and back to the same problem.  Called the company, and asked if indigestion was a side effect of the supplement and the rep, and then his supervisor, said they didn't know.  I asked if they kept any records of customers reporting this side effect, and was told they are not required to keep records, because this is not a prescription medication.

I used it once or twice a week in the mid morning at a water flavorer and for a boost. 3 years ago, a half scoop or a full scoop would be sufficient.

"This is a fairly expensive multivitamin at over twice the cost per daily dose of standard daily multivitamins. Much of this likely revolves around the actual content, which is significantly more than a standard multivitamin provides. A standard multivitamin generally has 100% of the recommended daily dose for each ingredient. In this case, however, we see about 20 times that for thiamin and riboflavin (B1 and B2), 15x that for B6, 10x that for B7 (biotin) and B12, and so forth. Essentially, you are getting a high dose of the B vitamins, but there's also twice the usual amount of copper, 5x the usual dose of pantothenic acid and well over 100% for Vitamins A and C.<br /><br />More of something good is not necessarily a good thing. There are potential side effects for taking more than the recommended quantity of several of the B vitamins. And those with certain medical disorders would want to be careful about several of the other components here. Bottom line: talk with your doctor before taking this particular multivitamin formulation, and if you're simply looking for a high quality multivitamin rather than wanting to experiment with high doses of any of these components, look elsewhere. In the meantime, if you do decide to take these, one pill rather than the product-recommended two a day would likely be the right place to start.<br /><br />Note that the content and nutritional information on the product label is underneath the main product label, which can be easily peeled back to reveal the information so that it's there on your shelf and won't be confused with other products.",High dose B vitamins and greater than typical overall dosages compared to standard multivitamin.,Allergic

"I had been taking the Kirkland general daily multivitamins (not women specific) and was curious to compare these. To be fair the Kirkland ones aren't vegan, but they are also much cheaper, so that's a bit of a wash. These are about 35% bigger than the Kirkland vitamins -- quite large, though I didn't have any difficulty swallowing them. They also definitely have a smell, though it's not terrible. The label was oddly hard to read ((maybe mine just had a funky printing job), but the bottle was easy to<br />open and close. The thing that was weird to me and dropped this to three stars is the very low level of calcium in the vitamins. They only offer 3% of the daily calcium allocation, while standard vitamins are usually 20 to 35%, and women's specific vitamins are usually a bit higher even than that. I don't drink nearly enough milk and have some history of osteoporosis in the family, so calcium is one of the most important supplements I watch for in a daily multivitamins. So that's a deal killer for me -- you could always take an additional supplement, but why bother when almost all other vitamin brands have plenty of cacium? All told, these are fine multivitamins for other nutrients, and bonus points for being vegan, but if you're needing calcium as part of your supplement like I am then you might want to consider another brand.",Oddly Low Calcium,Texture

"The product was what I ordered and expected.  I do wish that it was available in bottles of 60 or 100 tablets.<br /><br />My gripe is the outright Lies in the shipment tracking!  I have NEVER reviewed ANY shipment on Sunday andd I doubt that I ever will!  Also, the carriers RARELY bother waiting for us to answer the door, so it is a LIE when it says it was handed directly to me!  Most of the time, they tap lightly on our door, if at all, then place the package somewhere on our front porch and quickly scurry away.  They even did that with the laser printer.
