## Problem statement

People across the world observe Good Friday and Easter holidays to spend quality time with their families. While exchanging gifts during these holidays might not have been a tradition in the past, it has become one now.

An online retailer has launched a special sale of gifts for Good Friday. One of the main goals is to increase the desirability and the value of the products. With various promotional techniques, the retailer aims at driving ancillary traffic to the site, acquiring new customers, retaining the loyal ones, and growing the revenue. 

In this challenge, your task is to build a Machine Learning model that helps the retailer to predict and set the prices for different gift packages.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of certain parameters such as the type and category of the gift, applicable discounts on the gift, the number of packages bought in the past, and so on.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that can predict the prices for different gift packages.
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of time-series based regression. Regression is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning.
We challenge you to build a model that determines prices for various gifts for Good Friday and Easter.
