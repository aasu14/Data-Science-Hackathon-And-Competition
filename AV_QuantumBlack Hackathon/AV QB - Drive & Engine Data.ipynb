    "Weather data is already in PST and may not need any timezone conversion. You may consider the weather data to be constant for complete hour basis. For example- if the temperature is given to be 284.51 for 2017-02-14 19:00:00, it would be the same for time 2017-02-14 19:15:45 as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "Least deviation from the actual result would decide the accuracy of the output.\n",
    "For engine and drive features, we are going to use the absolute percent deviation in between pre-calculated output versus the output provided by you. For weather features, it is going to be calculated as per mean percentage deviation from the actual output.\n",
    "The final score is calculated using the deviation scores after applying weights as follows\n",
    "Score = 100[W1(1- engine_deviation) + W2(1- drive_deviation) + W3(1- weather_deviation)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality of code would be judged on the following parameters – functionality, reusability, modularity, documentation, testing and validation.\n",
    "Should be scalable to be executed on 5 GB data as well.\n",
    "Please note that scoring is going to be done using an automated script and difference in between the field names or order from the above-defined feature may result in zero scoring/error message due to the failure of the scoring script.\n",
    "Participants may do multiple submissions. They would have to select on the platform which one to be treated as the final submission. If not selected, the submission with the highest score would be considered as final.\n",
    "Final winners would be announced only after the submitted code reviews and the analysis of the rest of the document submissions made by the participants.\n",
    "Only 5 submissions per day are allowed\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Format\n",
    "Solution checker has 2 upload links - one for solution file (described above) and 1 for code files. Final submission must be done along with code files, however, other submissions can be just made with the solution file.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code File\n",
    "**Final submission must include the following relevant code files and documents. You can download a sample code file format here.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis for the raw data – This should contain all the profiling outputs and plots generated as part of exploratory analysis. Every data source should have an individual html file with the name as that of the data source.\n",
    "Data Quality issues report – Word/ PPT – High-level issues that are observed while working on the data. A single page for every data source.\n",
    "Codebase (python/Java/Spark) – Code which contains a central main file for the execution of the complete pipeline and generates the final CSV outputs.\n",
    "Final Model input file containing the features –\n",
    "As mentioned above in the Output Format segment.\n",
